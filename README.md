# the Lord of Rize
My first game making project

This not finished game is the cause of my curiosity about game making. This was the first time of me trying to make a game.

The consept is coming from my friends passion to his city. His city Rize, is famous with its tea and highlands. The character that I draw is my friend's caricaturised version. The targets are tea and the bullets are tea spoons. For background, I tried to draw a similar thing to Rize's villages and highlands, but I was not that succesful about that.
