# the Lord of Rize
My first game making project

This not finished game is the cause of my curiosity about game making. This was the first time of me trying to make a game. I used Game Maker Studio.

The consept is coming from my friends passion to his city. His city Rize, is famous with its tea and highlands.

The character that I draw is my friend's caricaturised version.

The targets are tea and the bullets are tea spoons.

For background, I tried to draw a similar thing to Rize's villages and highlands, but I was not that succesful about that. I also used sound's from Rize.

I think this project is achieved its purpose with giving me some idea about game-making. 

Here's a demo video of the game:
